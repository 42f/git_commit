# git_commit
[tooling] Simple script to automate git commit/push and create my personal messages standard format.

This script helps to have a consistent git message format with "[DEV]" section reflecting on what has been added by this commit, and "[NEXT]" about what is planned for the next commit.
It also automate git push with a y/n question at the end.
